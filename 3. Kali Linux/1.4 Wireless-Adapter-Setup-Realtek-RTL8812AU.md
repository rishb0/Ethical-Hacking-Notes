# Realtek RTL8812AU Wireless Adapter Setup
---
The `Realtek RTL8812AU` is a popular wireless adapter used for Wi-Fi penetration testing and packet injection. Installing drivers is essential for compatibility with Kali Linux.

## Update the package list
---
```bash
apt update
```

## Install required dependencies
---
This installs development tools and kernel headers needed to build and install the driver properly.
```bash
apt install dkms git build-essential libelf-dev linux-headers-$(uname -r)
```

## Install the RTL88xxAU DKMS Driver
---
Kali includes a maintained driver package for Realtek chipsets (including RTL8812AU).
```bash
apt install realtek-rtl88xxau-dkms
```
> Note: This will compile and install the driver automatically using DKMS, which ensures it stays installed across kernel updates.

## Reboot the system
---
A reboot ensures the new driver is loaded and working.
```bash
reboot
```
