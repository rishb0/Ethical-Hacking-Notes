# Installing Go (Golang) on Linux

This guide outlines the steps to install a specific version of Golang (Go) on a Linux system. It also includes instructions for setting up Go tools for offensive security purposes.

### 1. Check Existing Go Installation
***
Before installing a new version, check if Go is already installed:
```bash
go version
```
If Go is installed, it will return the version number. If not, you'll get an error.

### 2. Download Go
***
Visit the official Go download page:
*   https://go.dev/dl/

Direct link to the Go tarball (update as needed):
*   https://go.dev/dl/go1.24.5.linux-amd64.tar.gz

To download using `wget`:
```bash
wget https://go.dev/dl/go1.24.5.linux-amd64.tar.gz
```

### 3. Remove Existing Go Installation
***
Remove the existing Go installation (if any) to avoid conflicts:
```bash
apt remove golang-go
```

### 4. Remove Old Go Directory (if exists)
Check if the default installation directory exists:
```bash
ls /usr/local/go
```
If it does, remove it before extracting the new version:
```bash
rm -rf /usr/local/go 
```

```bash
tar -C /usr/local -xzf go1.24.5.linux-amd64.tar.gz 
```

After extraction, verify the contents:
```bash
ls /usr/local/go
```

### 5. Confirm Go Installation
***
Check the Go version to verify the new installation:
```bash
/usr/local/go/bin/go version
```

### 6. Set Up Environment Variables
***
Check your current `PATH`:
```bash
echo $PATH
```
Check your shell type:
```bash
echo $SHELL
```
Then, export the Go paths to your shell configuration file:
```bash
echo "export PATH=\$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin:\$HOME/go/bin" >> ~/.bashrc
echo "export PATH=\$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin:\$HOME/go/bin" >> ~/.zshrc
echo "export GOROOT=/usr/local/go" >> ~/.bashrc
echo "export GOROOT=/usr/local/go" >> ~/.zshrc
```
> ℹ️ After adding these lines, reload your shell or run `source ~/.bashrc` or `source ~/.zshrc` depending on your shell.

### 7. Verify Go is Working
***
```bash
go version
```
You should see the version you installed.

## Installing Go Tools for Offensive Security
***
A helpful Go tools installation script is available here:
*   https://github.com/InfoSecWarrior/Offensive-Pentesting-Scripts/tree/main/Gotools-Install

### 1. Become Root
***
Switch to the root user:
```bash
su - root
```

### 2. Download the Script
***
Navigate to the `/opt` directory:
```bash
cd /opt
```
Download the install script:
```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/InfoSecWarrior/Offensive-Pentesting-Scripts/main/Gotools-Install/gotools-install.sh
```
Make it executable:
```bash
chmod +x /opt/gotools-install.sh
```

### 3. Run the Installer
***
Execute the script:
```bash
./gotools-install.sh
```
This script installs a collection of commonly used Go-based offensive security tools.
