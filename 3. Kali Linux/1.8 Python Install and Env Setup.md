## Python Installation and Environment Setup

This guide covers how to install Python (both Python 2.7 and Python 3), set up `pip` for both versions, install `beautifulsoup4`, and create an isolated Python environment using `venv`.

***
### Checking Existing Python & Pip Versions
*   Check the installed Python and pip versions on your system.

```bash
python -V
```
```bash
python2.7 -V
```
```bash
pip -V
```
```bash
pip2.7 -V
```

### Installing BeautifulSoup4
***
*   Install `beautifulsoup4` using both Python 2.7 and the default Python environment.

```bash
pip install beautifulsoup4
```
```bash
pip2.7 install beautifulsoup4
```

### Installing Pip for Python 2.7
***
*   If `pip2.7` is not available, you can manually install it using the `get-pip.py` script for Python 2.7.
*   Download the installer:

```bash
wget https://bootstrap.pypa.io/pip/2.7/get-pip.py -O get-pip.py
```
*   Run the installer with Python 2.7:

```bash
python2.7 get-pip.py
```
*   Verify pip2.7 installation:

```bash
pip2.7 -V
```
*   Reinstall `beautifulsoup4` just to confirm pip works:

```bash
pip2.7 install beautifulsoup4
```

### Installing Pip for Default Python (Python 3+)
***
*   Use this if `pip` isn't already available for your main Python version:

```bash
wget https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py -O get-pip.py
```
*   Run with the default Python:

```bash
python get-pip.py
```

### Installing Full Python 3 Support & venv Module
***
*   Install Python 3's full package and the virtual environment module:

```bash
apt install python3.13-venv
```
```bash
apt install python3-full python-is-python3
```

### Creating a Virtual Environment
***
*   Create a dedicated environment for your Python projects.

```bash
mkdir /opt/python-environment
```
```bash
python3 -m venv /opt/python-environment
```

### Installing Pip in the Virtual Environment
***
*   If pip is not already in the environment, download and install it:

```bash
wget https://bootstrap.pypa.io/pip/get-pip.py -O get-pip.py
```
*   Use the virtual environment's Python interpreter to run the installer:

```bash
/opt/python-environment/bin/python get-pip.py
```
*   Verify the pip version inside the virtual environment:

```bash
/opt/python-environment/bin/pip -V
```

### Setting System-wide `pip` to the Virtual Environment Version
***
*   Check the current pip binary path:

```bash
which pip
```
*   Remove the current symlink (if needed):

```bash
ls -lh /usr/local/bin/pip
```
```bash
rm -f /usr/local/bin/pip
```
*   Recreate the symlink to point to the virtual environment pip:

```bash
ln -s /opt/python-environment/bin/pip /usr/local/bin/pip
```
*   Confirm pip is working:

```bash
pip -V
```
*   Install `beautifulsoup4` globally via the virtual environment pip:

```bash
pip install beautifulsoup4
```
