# Environment Types in Software Development
***
Software systems are typically deployed and tested across different environments to ensure stability, security, and performance. The three most common environments are:

## 🏭 Production
The **live environment** where real users interact with the application.

*   **Purpose:** Delivers the final version of the application to end users.
*   **Characteristics:**
    *   Fully optimized and stable
    *   Real-time data
    *   Monitored and secured
    *   Minimal downtime allowed
*   **Risks:** Any issue directly affects users and business operations.

## 🧪 Staging
A **pre-production environment** used to test applications in a setup that closely mimics production.

*   **Purpose:** Final testing ground before release to production.
*   **Characteristics:**
    *   Mirrors production environment (hardware, software, database structure)
    *   Used for UAT (User Acceptance Testing) and regression testing
    *   Isolated from production data (can use sanitized copies)
*   **Best Practice:** Should replicate production as closely as possible.

## 🛠️ Development (Dev)
The **coding and integration environment** for developers.

*   **Purpose:** Write, build, and test new features or fixes.
*   **Characteristics:**
    *   Frequent code changes and commits
    *   Often includes debugging and logging tools
    *   Uses mock or seeded data
    *   Typically unstable or partially complete
*   **Best Practice:** Isolate feature branches and use CI/CD pipelines to promote code safely.

| Environment     | Purpose                  | Stability | Data Type      | Audience         |
| :-------------- | :----------------------- | :-------- | :------------- | :--------------- |
| **Production**  | End-user use             | High      | Real           | External users   |
| **Staging**     | Pre-release testing      | Medium    | Realistic copy | Internal testers |
| **Development** | Feature development/test | Low       | Mock/Fake      | Developers       |

> 📝 These environments typically follow a **deployment pipeline**:
> Development → Staging → Production
