## WHOIS Lookup

WHOIS Lookup is a process used to retrieve information about who owns a domain name (like example.com). Here's a brief explanation:

---
### What is WHOIS Lookup?

-   WHOIS Lookup is a protocol (and a set of databases) that stores information about domain name registrations.
-   When you perform a WHOIS Lookup, you can see details such as:
    -   Domain owner (registrant) name (if not protected by privacy).
    -   Contact email and phone number.
    -   Domain creation and expiration dates.
    -   Registrar (the company where the domain is registered).
    -   Name servers (DNS servers used by the domain).
    -   Status of the domain (e.g., `clientTransferProhibited`, `ok`, etc.).

### Why Use WHOIS Lookup?

-   **Security Investigations:** Check if a suspicious domain is linked to known malicious activity.
-   **Brand Protection:** See who registered domains similar to your brand.
-   **Domain Purchase:** Contact domain owners if you want to buy a domain.
-   **Technical Management:** Verify the domain's DNS records and status.
-   **Legal Compliance:** Ensure your domain registration information is accurate and updated.
-   **SEO Research:** Understand domain age, history, and ownership for SEO and backlink analysis.

### How to Perform a WHOIS Lookup?

You can use:
-   ✅ **Web tools** (like those listed below).
-   ✅ **Command-line tools** (like the `whois` command on Linux).

**Example using Linux:**

```bash
whois example.com
```

This will show the WHOIS record of `example.com` right in the terminal.

### Examples of WHOIS Lookup Commands

-   **Basic WHOIS Lookup:**
```bash
whois google.com
```
-   **Check multiple domains at once (using a loop in Bash):**
```bash
for domain in example.com test.com domain.com; do whois $domain; done
```
-   **Save WHOIS data to a file:**
```bash
whois example.com > example-whois.txt
```
-   **Use a proxy WHOIS server (sometimes needed for certain TLDs):**
```bash
whois -h whois.nic.xyz example.xyz
```
