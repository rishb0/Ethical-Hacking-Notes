# Reverse IP Domain Lookup
---

>THIS IS NOT JUST IP TO DOMAIN LOOKUP, BUT IT IS GETTING ALL DOMAINS RUNNING FROM A SPECIFIC IP ADDRESS.

Reverse IP lookup reveals which **domains** are hosted on a specific **IP address**. This is useful in OSINT, pentesting, and infrastructure mapping.

## Use Cases
*   Discover other domains sharing the same web server
*   Identify shared hosting or misconfigured virtual hosts
*   Uncover staging, dev, or internal sites
*   Pivot to related targets in recon or bug bounty

## Notes
---
*   Shared hosting can return **hundreds of domains** per IP
*   Dedicated IPs may show only one domain
*   Cloud/CDN providers (like Cloudflare) will show many unrelated domains

## Defensive Tip
---
*   Use dedicated IPs or properly configure virtual hosts
*   Consider CDN/WAF services to mask real IP
