# Open Ports Check
---

An **open port check** allows you to test if specific **TCP ports** on a target IP or domain are accessible from the internet. This is useful for reconnaissance, troubleshooting, and verifying firewall rules.

## Use Cases
*   Identify publicly accessible services (SSH, RDP, FTP, HTTP, etc.)
*   Check firewall or NAT configurations
*   Discover potentially vulnerable or misconfigured ports
*   Validate port forwarding and external access

## Online Port Scanning Tools
---
*   **[ViewDNS Port Scan](https://viewdns.info/portscan/)**
    *   Basic TCP port scan from an external location
    *   Useful for testing exposure of services

*   **[YouGetSignal Open Ports Tool](https://www.yougetsignal.com/tools/open-ports/)**
    *   Fast and simple port scanner
    *   Supports checking a single port (e.g., 22, 80, 443)
    *   Good for quick exposure tests

*   **[DNSChecker Port Scanner](https://dnschecker.org/port-scanner.php)**
    *   Scans multiple TCP ports across multiple servers
    *   Useful for verifying port accessibility globally

*   **[PortChecker.co](https://portchecker.co/)**
    *   Check if a port is open on your IP (client-side)
    *   Good for testing if a home or office router forwards a port properly

## Common Ports to Test
---

| Port | Service |
| :--- | :--- |
| 21 | FTP |
| 22 | SSH |
| 23 | Telnet |
| 25 | SMTP |
| 53 | DNS |
| 80 | HTTP |
| 110 | POP3 |
| 143 | IMAP |
| 443 | HTTPS |
| 3306 | MySQL |
| 3389 | RDP (Windows) |

## Defense Tips
---
*   Close all unnecessary ports at firewall level
*   Use **port-knocking** or **VPN** for sensitive remote services
*   Regularly scan your public IPs for accidental exposure
*   Monitor logs for unauthorized access attempts

## CLI Alternative
---
```bash
nmap -Pn -p 1-1000 example.com
```
