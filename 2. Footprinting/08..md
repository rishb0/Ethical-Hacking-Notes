# Minification

Minification is a web performance technique where unnecessary characters are removed from the source code of web files, such as JavaScript, CSS, and HTML, without affecting how the code functions. These characters may include white spaces, line breaks, comments, or formatting used only to make the code more readable for humans. The goal of minification is to reduce the size of the file, so that it loads faster when sent over the internet to the user's browser. Minification does not change the actual logic or behavior of the code. For example, `function sayHello() { console.log("Hello"); }` can be minified to `function sayHello(){console.log("Hello");}`. Minification is done by tools like UglifyJS, Terser, or online minifiers, and it is especially useful for improving the performance of websites, particularly those using HTTPS where every byte transferred must go through an encrypted channel, adding slight overhead.

# Obfuscation

Obfuscation is the process of intentionally making code difficult to understand for humans while keeping it functional for machines. This technique is mostly used in JavaScript and other client-side programming languages to protect intellectual property, hide logic from reverse engineers, and increase the difficulty of malicious code analysis. Unlike minification, which simply removes extra characters, obfuscation renames variables and functions to meaningless names (e.g., `a1`, `b2`, `c3`) and sometimes even changes the code structure using logic rewriting, control flow flattening, and string encoding. Obfuscation does not secure the code in a cryptographic sense, but it increases the difficulty for someone trying to read, understand, or tamper with the code. Obfuscation is commonly applied in combination with minification in production web applications to protect source code distributed to browsers over HTTPS.

# Compression

Compression in the context of web and network security refers to reducing the size of data before it is transmitted over a connection, particularly an SSL/TLS encrypted channel. Compression can apply to files, web pages, or the TLS data stream itself. Common compression algorithms for web content include Gzip, Brotli, and Deflate. These algorithms identify and remove redundancy in data, shrinking the payload size. For example, a 500KB HTML file can often be compressed to less than 100KB. This greatly speeds up page load times and reduces bandwidth usage. However, compression can introduce security risks, such as in the case of the CRIME and BREACH attacks, where compressed encrypted data was exploited to leak sensitive information. For this reason, compression in TLS-level communication is often disabled by default in modern browsers and web servers. Instead, content compression is applied at the HTTP level before encryption takes place.

# Encryption

Encryption is the process of converting readable data (plaintext) into an unreadable format (ciphertext) using a cryptographic algorithm and a secret key. In the context of SSL/TLS, encryption ensures that data sent between the client (such as a web browser) and the server (such as a website) is kept confidential and cannot be read or tampered with by attackers. SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) and its successor TLS (Transport Layer Security) are protocols that use encryption to secure web traffic, resulting in HTTPS connections. Encryption in TLS involves symmetric encryption (for data exchange), asymmetric encryption (for key exchange), and hashing (for message integrity). When a user visits a site with HTTPS, the browser and server negotiate the encryption algorithm and keys, after which all communication is encrypted. Encryption protects login credentials, payment details, cookies, and all other sensitive data exchanged during a session.

# Uglification

Uglification is another name for minification, but it typically refers to the process of making the code not just smaller, but also intentionally harder to read. It is often used as a synonym for minification when applied to JavaScript, especially when the process includes both minification and obfuscation steps. Uglification renames variables to single-letter names, removes whitespace and formatting, and rearranges code in such a way that, while still valid and executable, it becomes almost unreadable to humans. The term comes from the tool ‚ÄúUglifyJS,‚Äù which is a popular JavaScript uglifier/minifier. Uglification is commonly used in web development pipelines to protect the code and reduce its size before deploying to production servers. Like minification, it is beneficial for performance, especially over encrypted HTTPS connections, where smaller payloads result in faster load times and reduced server load.

# Connection Reuse

Connection reuse is a network optimization technique where a single TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) or TLS connection is kept open and reused for multiple requests or sessions instead of creating a new connection each time. In HTTPS, every new connection usually requires a full TLS handshake, which involves several round-trip communications and cryptographic calculations. Reusing the same connection avoids repeating these steps, thus saving time, bandwidth, and CPU resources. Connection reuse is typically implemented through HTTP/1.1 keep-alive or HTTP/2 multiplexing. In HTTP/2, multiple requests and responses can be sent simultaneously over a single TLS connection. CDNs and browsers use connection reuse to speed up web applications and reduce latency. This technique is especially important in mobile networks or high-latency environments where connection setup can be expensive.

### üîπ TLS False Start

TLS False Start is a performance optimization technique that allows the client to send application data (like an HTTP request) immediately after it sends the last handshake message in a TLS connection, without waiting for the server to finish its part of the handshake. Normally, a TLS handshake is completed only after the client and server exchange all necessary messages and confirm key agreement. This process requires multiple round trips. False Start saves one round trip by letting the client send data early, reducing total connection time. It is only allowed when certain secure cipher suites are negotiated and the client has high confidence in the server's identity and capabilities. Not all servers support False Start, and it is only used when both the client (usually a browser) and the server agree. This technique is supported in TLS 1.2 and by browsers like Chrome and Firefox when connecting to high-performance or CDN-hosted websites.

### üîπ Session Resumption

Session resumption is a method used in TLS to avoid the performance cost of repeating a full handshake every time a client connects to a server. In a full handshake, the client and server perform public-key cryptography, exchange certificates, and negotiate session keys, which is computationally expensive and takes multiple round trips. Session resumption allows the client and server to reuse the cryptographic parameters from a previous session, significantly reducing the handshake time. There are two main methods for session resumption: Session IDs and Session Tickets. Session ID resumption stores session information on the server, while Session Tickets store the encrypted session state on the client side. TLS 1.3 improves on this with a built-in session resumption mechanism using Pre-Shared Keys (PSK) and allows optional 0-RTT (Zero Round Trip Time) data transmission. Session resumption helps speed up HTTPS websites, conserve resources, and improve user experience, especially in high-frequency or mobile-based applications.
