# Autonomous System (AS / ASN / IP) Lookup
---
Autonomous Systems (AS) are large networks or groups of IP prefixes under the control of a single organization that presents a common routing policy to the internet.

## What Can You Look Up?
---
*   **ASN (Autonomous System Number):** A unique number (e.g., AS15169) assigned to each AS.
*   **AS Name/Organization:** The organization that owns the ASN.
*   **IP to ASN:** Identify the ASN responsible for a given IP address.
*   **ASN to IP Range:** View all IP ranges (CIDR blocks) announced by an ASN.
