# Websites Built With: Technologies, Detection Tools, and Security Considerations

---

## 1. Common Website Files and Their Purposes

Websites often expose certain informational files that can provide insights into their setup:

| File Name | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| `readme.html` | Project or website information, version details, credits, and descriptions |
| `readme.txt` | Similar to `readme.html`, often plain text documentation about the site or software |
| `readme.md` | Markdown-formatted project details and instructions |
| `license.txt` | Contains licensing terms and conditions for the website or software |
| `feed` / `feed.xml` | RSS or Atom feed files used for syndicating website updates |

- Check for all these files under themes, plugins, and all places.

### Security Implications of Exposing These Files

-   **Information Disclosure:** Reveals sensitive details such as software versions, frameworks, CMS types, or server configurations that could aid attackers.
-   **Fingerprinting:** Attackers and security professionals use these files to identify underlying technologies and potential vulnerabilities.
-   **Automated Scanners:** Tools like WhatWeb, BuiltWith, and Wappalyzer rely on such files to perform technology detection and profiling.
