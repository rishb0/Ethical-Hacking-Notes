## Manually Checking BGP Routing Details

BGP (Border Gateway Protocol) is the “postal system” of the Internet.  
It tells routers **which Autonomous System (AS)** is responsible for a block of IPs and how to reach it.

---

### **Step 1 — Find the ASN**

```bash
whois 1.1.1.1 | grep OriginAS
```

Example:

```
OriginAS: AS13335
```

This means Cloudflare is announcing that IP block.

---

### **Step 2 — Check the BGP Route**

You can query **public route collectors**:

```bash
bgp.he.net
```

Search the ASN (e.g., `AS13335`).

You’ll see:

- All prefixes announced
    
- Peering relationships
    
- Countries served
    

---

### **Step 3 — Live Route Check**

Use RIPE’s tools:

```bash
https://stat.ripe.net/1.1.1.1
```

You’ll get:

- Current announced prefix
    
- All upstream providers
    
- Routing history
    

---

### **Step 4 — CLI Tools**

Install `bgpview` or `whois` + `dig`:

```bash
apt install whois
apt install bind9-dnsutils
```

Example:

```bash
dig +short TXT _netblocks.cloudflare.com
```

Shows Cloudflare’s announced ranges.
