# How to Check if a Website is Using a CDN

A website using a **Content Delivery Network (CDN)** often shows signs such as altered DNS records, CDN-specific HTTP headers, or use of CDN provider IP ranges. Here are several ways to check:

---
#### 1. Use Online Tools

##### CDN Finder Tools

-   https://www.cdnplanet.com/tools/cdnfinder/
-   https://www.whatsmydns.net/
	-   https://www.webpagetest.org/ → Check the "CDN Provider" column in the result waterfall.

Test for

#### 2. Check HTTP Response Headers

Use `curl` or browser developer tools to inspect HTTP headers.

```bash
curl -I https://example.com
```

Look for headers like:

-   `cf-ray`, `cf-cache-status` → Cloudflare
-   `x-amz-cf-id` → AWS CloudFront
-   `x-akamai-*`, `akamai-*` → Akamai
-   `x-cache`, `x-served-by`, `via` → Generic CDN or caching servers

---
#### 3. Check DNS Records
CDNs often provide custom CNAME records.
```bash
nslookup example.com
```

Or:
```bash
dig example.com
```

Look for CNAMEs or A records pointing to:

-   `*.cloudflare.net`
-   `*.akamaiedge.net`
-   `*.fastly.net`
-   `*.cdn.cloudflare.net`, `*.edgekey.net`, etc.

---
#### 4. Analyze IP Address Ownership

Get the IP of the website:
```bash
ping example.com
```

Then look up the IP:
```bash
whois <IP-ADDRESS>
```

If the IP belongs to known CDN providers like Cloudflare, Akamai, AWS, etc., the site is likely using a CDN.

---
#### 5. Use Browser Developer Tools

-   Open **Developer Tools** in your browser (usually F12).
-   Go to the **Network** tab.
-   Reload the page.
-   Inspect resource headers and look for CDN clues in the **Response Headers** or **Remote Address** fields.

---
#### 6. Use BuiltWith or Wappalyzer

-   https://builtwith.com/
-   https://www.wappalyzer.com/

These tools can detect CDN usage along with other technologies.

---
#### 7. CDN Performance checker

Check CDN performance from all over the world.
