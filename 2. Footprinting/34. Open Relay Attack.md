# Open Relay Attack: Complete Technical Breakdown

This document provides an in-depth explanation of the **Open Relay Attack** in email systems. It explains every element involved in the email flow, vulnerabilities, how relaying works, what causes a server to become an open relay, and how attackers exploit it. This includes SMTP-level understanding, examples, configurations, and real-world defense mechanisms. It also explains the roles of MUA, MSA, MTA, and MDA, especially in modern solutions like Mailcow.

## What is an Open Relay Server?

An **open relay** is a **misconfigured SMTP server** that allows **anyone** on the internet to send emails **through your server**, even if:

- They are not part of your organization/domain
    
- They are not authenticated users
    
- The recipients are outside your domain
    

### Why Is This a Problem?

If your server is open for relaying, it can be exploited to:

- Send spam or phishing emails
    
- Spoof other domains (like `ceo@paypal.com`)
    
- Hide the attacker's original source
    
- Blacklist your server's IP and domain across the internet

## How SMTP Email Flow Normally Works

SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) is used for **sending and routing** email between servers. The basic components and flow are:

### 1. MUA (Mail User Agent)

- This is the user's application, like Outlook, Thunderbird, or webmail UI.
    
- User composes and sends the email here.
    

### 2. MSA (Mail Submission Agent)

- This takes the email from the MUA.
    
- It **authenticates** the user.
    
- Then, it submits it to the next hop: MTA.
    

### 3. MTA (Mail Transfer Agent)

- It routes the mail to the destination domain's MTA (or intermediate MTAs).
    
- It performs DNS lookups to find `MX` records of the recipient domain.
    
- Examples: Postfix, Exim, Sendmail
    

### 4. MDA (Mail Delivery Agent)

- It delivers the mail to the recipient's inbox.
    
- Examples: Dovecot, Maildrop

## What is Mail Relaying?

Relaying is when one MTA forwards email **from one domain to another**.

### Legitimate Example

```
Sender → Gmail SMTP (MTA) → Postfix (intermediate relay) → Outlook MTA → Inbox
```

- Each MTA in the chain should trust the previous hop or be properly authenticated.
    

### Open Relay Example

```
Attacker → Your Server (Open Relay) → Victim's Mail Server
```

- Your server wrongly accepts the mail and forwards it to the victim's server.
    
- It **does not validate** that the sender is allowed to send mail **from that domain**.

## SMTP Commands Used by Attacker

```
HELO attacker.com
MAIL FROM:<ceo@paypal.com>
RCPT TO:<victim@gmail.com>
DATA
This is a fake email.
.
QUIT
```

This is a **raw SMTP session**. If your server accepts this from an unauthenticated source, and relays it to Gmail, it is vulnerable.

## Why SPF, DKIM, and DMARC Don’t Save You

### SPF

- SPF is checked by the **recipient server**, not by the **open relay**.
    
- If your server relays it, and Gmail sees that your server is not allowed in `paypal.com` SPF → it may reject or mark as spam.
    

### DKIM

- The attacker can’t sign email as `paypal.com` because they don’t have the **private key**.
    
- But if DKIM is missing or invalid, it reduces trust.
    

### DMARC

- DMARC tells recipient servers what to do if SPF and DKIM fail:
    
    - `none`: do nothing
        
    - `quarantine`: put in spam
        
    - `reject`: block
        
- Again, this is only **enforced by the recipient**, not your open relay.
    

---

## Why Only the First MTA is Responsible?

SMTP was designed in an **open, trust-based model**. That’s why:

- The first MTA accepts the email and makes forwarding decisions
    
- Other MTAs **assume** the first MTA did the authentication
    
- They do **not re-verify** SPF/DKIM/DMARC
    

That’s why open relays are dangerous — they are **entry points** to abuse.

---

## Why Not Send Directly?

Attackers can send directly using their own MTA, but they want to:

- Use **trusted third-party servers** to evade spam filters
    
- **Spoof the source** IP to confuse logs
    
- Hide their identity
    

So they hunt for open relays and send **spoofed mail** via them.

---

## How Are You Blamed?

- When your open relay forwards mail, the receiving server logs:
    
    - Your IP
        
    - Your domain
        
    - Your email headers (Received: from ... by ...)
        
- If the mail is spam or malicious:
    
    - **Spamhaus** and others blacklist your IP/domain
        
    - You get throttled or blocked by Gmail, Outlook, etc.
        
    - Your legit mail stops delivering
        

---

## Why Forwarding Exists At All?

Forwarding is needed for:

- Load balancing
    
- Internal routing
    
- Legacy setups
    
- External SMTP relay services
    

But it must be done **securely** — allow only:

- Authenticated users
    
- Whitelisted IPs/domains
    

---

## How to Detect and Test Open Relay

Use the `telnet` or `swaks` command to simulate an email send:

```bash
swaks --to someone@gmail.com --from spoof@paypal.com --server yourdomain.com
```

If your server accepts it and forwards → it is open relay.

---

## How to Fix Open Relay

### 1. Require Authentication

- In Postfix:
    

```conf
smtpd_recipient_restrictions =
    permit_mynetworks,
    permit_sasl_authenticated,
    reject_unauth_destination
```

### 2. Whitelist Networks Only

- Allow relaying only from specific IP ranges (your office, apps, etc.)
    

### 3. Block External to External Routing

- Do not allow mail from external to external domains without auth

## What is Mailcow?

**Mailcow** is a popular self-hosted email server suite. It combines all email system components in one:

|Role|Component|
|---|---|
|MUA|Webmail (Rainloop or SOGo)|
|MSA|Dovecot Submission|
|MTA|Postfix|
|MDA|Dovecot|
|Filter|Rspamd|

### Why Mailcow is Relevant Here?

If you're running your mail server (like in Mailcow), it is **your responsibility** to:

- Properly configure relaying
    
- Enforce anti-spam policies
    
- Log and monitor traffic
    
- Protect your server from being an open relay
    

---

## Final Summary

An open relay is a **misconfigured MTA** that lets attackers use your server to send email to anyone. The attack works because your server doesn't verify sender identity or enforce destination rules.

The damage includes your domain/IP getting blacklisted, your emails undelivered, and reputation loss.

Understanding how **SMTP, MTA, SPF, DKIM, and DMARC** work together is essential to securing your infrastructure.

Always:

- Enable authentication
    
- Enforce `reject_unauth_destination`
    
- Check your configs regularly
