## 📖 What is OSINT?
---
Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT) is the process of collecting and analyzing publicly available information to produce actionable intelligence. It involves gathering data from open sources like the internet, public records, media, and social platforms.

OSINT is widely used in:
*   Cybersecurity
*   Law enforcement
*   Military intelligence
*   Business intelligence
*   Investigative journalism
*   Threat hunting and cybercrime investigations

## 🔑 Key Components of OSINT
---
### 📁 Sources of OSINT
*   **Internet:**
    Websites, blogs, forums, company websites.
*   **Social Media:**
    Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, LinkedIn, Telegram, etc.
*   **Public Records:**
    Government databases, court filings, company registries.
*   **News & Media:**
    News websites, TV, radio broadcasts.
*   **Academic Databases:**
    Research papers, patents, scientific journals.
*   **Geospatial Data:**
    Satellite imagery, maps (Google Maps, OpenStreetMap), GPS metadata.
*   **Technical Data:**
    WHOIS, DNS records, IP information, exposed devices.

### 🔧 Common Techniques
*   **Web Scraping:**
    Automating data collection from websites.
*   **Social Media Monitoring:**
    Tracking posts, mentions, and user behavior.
*   **Google Dorking:**
    Using advanced Google search operators to find sensitive or hidden information.
*   **Metadata Analysis:**
    Extracting hidden information from files (e.g., EXIF data in images, PDF metadata).
*   **Geolocation:**
    Pinpointing locations based on images, social media posts, or IP addresses.
*   **Passive Footprinting:**
    Gathering information without interacting with the target.
*   **Active Footprinting:**
    Directly interacting with the target (e.g., DNS queries, port scanning).

*   ❌ Misuse of OSINT for stalking, harassment, or cybercrime is illegal.

### 🚀 Example OSINT Workflow
1.  **Footprinting:**
    Search for domains, IPs, WHOIS, DNS Info.
2.  **Social Media Scraping:**
    Collect information from user profiles, posts, locations.
3.  **Metadata Extraction:**
    Download public documents or images and extract metadata.
4.  **Technical Recon:**
    Use tools like Shodan to find exposed devices.
5.  **Analysis:**
    Correlate data to generate insights.
6.  **Reporting:**
    Document findings with evidence screenshots, links, and summaries.
