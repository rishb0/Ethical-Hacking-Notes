# NDA in Penetration Testing
***
In penetration testing (pentest), an NDA (Non-Disclosure Agreement) is a **legal contract** signed between the **client** and the **penetration tester or security company** to protect sensitive information.

## What is an NDA in Pentesting?
***
An **NDA** ensures that:
*   All **confidential information** shared or discovered during the engagement remains **private**.
*   The tester does **not disclose, reuse, or share** any protected information.
*   The client can safely disclose **internal systems, network architecture, credentials, etc.**

## Key Components of a Pentesting NDA
