# Google Hacking Database (GHDB) & Google Dorks

Google Dorking (or Google Hacking) uses advanced Google search operators to discover publicly accessible sensitive data, configuration files, or vulnerabilities. This technique is widely used in cybersecurity, OSINT, penetration testing, and digital forensics.

## What Is the Google Hacking Database (GHDB)?

The **Google Hacking Database (GHDB)** is a repository of crafted Google search queries (a.k.a. **Google Dorks**) used to identify:

• Exposed credentials  
• Open directories  
• Webcams and admin portals  
• Backup/config files  
• Database dumps
