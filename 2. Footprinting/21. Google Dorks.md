# Google Hacking Database (GHDB) & Google Dorks

Google Dorking (or Google Hacking) uses advanced Google search operators to discover publicly accessible sensitive data, configuration files, or vulnerabilities. This technique is widely used in cybersecurity, OSINT, penetration testing, and digital forensics.

## What Is the Google Hacking Database (GHDB)?

The **Google Hacking Database (GHDB)** is a repository of crafted Google search queries (a.k.a. **Google Dorks**) used to identify:

• Exposed credentials  
• Open directories  
• Webcams and admin portals  
• Backup/config files  
• Database dumps

## Use Cases

### Information Gathering

• Locate login portals, config files, or directories.  
• Discover hidden or forgotten content.

### Open Source Intelligence (OSINT)

• Identify leaks related to organizations or people.  
• Extract emails, usernames, phone numbers.

### Penetration Testing

• Find known vulnerabilities via exposed panels or default pages.
• Enumerate possible attack surfaces.

### Bug Bounty Hunting

• Discover exposed dev/staging environments.  
• Check for misconfigured S3 buckets, Git directories, etc.

## Why It Matters

• **Proactive Defense**: Helps sysadmins identify leaks before attackers do.  
• **Threat Intelligence**: Aids red teaming and incident response teams.  
• **Security Awareness**: Organizations become more vigilant about exposure.

## Popular Google Dork Patterns

| Purpose | Dork Example |
|---------|--------------|
| Exposed Login Pages | `inurl:admin login` |
| Directory Listing | `"index of /" site:example.com` |
| Configuration Files | `ext:env` |
| Database Dumps | `filetype:sql "insert into" -github` |
| Logs with Credentials | `filetype:log intext:password` |
| Exposed Cameras | `inurl:view/view.shtml` |
| Search Within a Site | `site:example.com confidential` |
| Find PDFs | `filetype:pdf "internal use only"` |
| Public Git Repos | `inurl:.git -github` |
| Open Backup Files | `ext:bak` |

## Types of Google Search Operators

Google Search Operators can be classified into two main categories:

### Basic Operators

These are simple modifiers that help refine everyday search queries. They are commonly used by casual users to improve search relevance.

#### Examples & Usage

| Operator | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `site:` | Restrict results to a specific website or domain | `site:example.com login` |
| `intitle:` | Show pages with a specific word in the title | `intitle:admin` |
| `inurl:` | Show pages with keywords in the URL | `inurl:login` |
| `filetype:` / `ext:` | Search for a specific file type | `filetype:pdf report` |
| `intext:` | Match text within the body content | `intext:"confidential"` |

### Advanced Operators

These allow for **more complex and powerful queries**, primarily used by:

• Cybersecurity professionals  
• OSINT investigators  
• Penetration testers  
• Digital forensic analysts

#### Examples & Usage

| Operator | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `allinurl:` | Search pages where all terms appear in the URL | `allinurl:admin login` |
| `allintitle:` | Search pages where all terms are in the title | `allintitle:index of` |
| `allintext:` | All specified words must appear in body text | `allintext:username password` |
| `link:` | Find pages linking to a URL (limited use today) | `link:example.com` |
| `related:` | Find sites related to a specified domain | `related:example.com` |
| `*` (wildcard) | Acts as a placeholder for any unknown word | `"password * gmail.com"` |
| `..` (range) | Search within a numeric range | `camera price 1000..5000` |

### Summary Table

| Type | Audience | Use Case Examples |
|------|----------|-------------------|
| Basic Operators | General Users | Refine search results, locate content |
| Advanced Operators | IT Pros, Pentesters, Analysts | Find exposures, vulnerabilities, leaks |• Enumerate possible attack surfaces.

### Bug Bounty Hunting

• Discover exposed dev/staging environments.  
• Check for misconfigured S3 buckets, Git directories, etc.

## Why It Matters

• **Proactive Defense**: Helps sysadmins identify leaks before attackers do.  
• **Threat Intelligence**: Aids red teaming and incident response teams.  
• **Security Awareness**: Organizations become more vigilant about exposure.

## Types of Google Search Operators

Google Search Operators can be classified into two main categories:

---

## Google Search Basic Operators

These **basic search operators** help refine Google queries and improve search accuracy. Ideal for both casual and technical users.

### + (Force Inclusion)

> ▲ **Deprecated:** No longer supported in modern Google Search, but historically used to force inclusion of a term.

*   **Purpose:** Ensure a specific keyword is included in results.
*   **Example:**

```
cybersecurity +training
```

Ensures that the word "**training**" appears in the results.

### - (Exclude Term)

*   **Purpose:** Exclude specific words from search results.
*   **Example:**

```
cybersecurity -training
```

Omits any results containing the word "**training**".

### ~ (Suggest Similar Terms)

> ▲ **Deprecated:** May not work reliably in current search behavior.

*   **Purpose:** Search for synonyms and related terms.
*   **Example:**
```
~hacking
```

Returns results for **hacking**, **security**, **penetration testing**, etc.

### .. (Search Within a Range)

*   **Purpose:** Search within a numeric range (years, prices, versions, etc.).
*   **Example:**

```
cybersecurity trends 2015..2023
```

Finds results referencing years **2015 to 2023**.

### * (Wildcard)

*   **Purpose:** Acts as a placeholder for unknown or variable words.
*   **Example:**

```
best * security tools
```

Matches results like "**best web security tools**", "**best cloud security tools**", etc.

### " " (Exact Match)

*   **Purpose:** Search for an exact word or phrase.
*   **Example:**

```
"penetration testing guide"
```

Only returns pages with the **exact phrase** inside quotes.

### OR (Logical Operator)

*   **Purpose:** Show results that include **either** one term or the other.
*   **Example:**

```
malware OR virus
```

Returns pages containing "**malware**", "**virus**", or both.

---
### Tip: Combine Operators

You can **mix and match** multiple operators for powerful searches.

**Example:**

```
"cybersecurity guide" -ebook filetype:pdf 2020..2024
```

Finds **PDF guides** about cybersecurity from **2020 to 2024**, **excluding eBooks**.

---
## Advanced Operators

Google's advanced search operators help refine and target search queries with precision. They're widely used in cybersecurity, OSINT, bug bounty, and digital forensics investigations.

### Search Rules
---
1.  **No Space Between Operator and Term**
    Operators should be attached directly to the keyword.
    Correct: `intitle:armourinfosec`
    Incorrect: `intitle: armourinfosec`

2.  **Case Insensitivity**
    Google search is **not case-sensitive**.
    `intitle:CyberSecurity` = `intitle:cybersecurity`

3.  **Handling Multi-word Terms**
    Use **double quotes (" ")** or **dots (.)** for phrases.
    Example:
    *   `intitle:"Ethical Hacking"`
    *   `inurl:ethical.hacking.tutorial`

4.  **Combining Operators**
    You can combine multiple operators for complex, targeted queries.
    Example:
```
site:github.com intitle:"README" intext:"api_key"
```
