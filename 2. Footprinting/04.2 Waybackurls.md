# Waybackurls

**Waybackurls** is a powerful tool by **Tomnomnom** for retrieving archived URLs from the Wayback Machine. It is particularly useful for security assessments, as it helps uncover endpoints that may no longer be accessible on the live site but are still archived.

- Pulls **historical URLs** from the **Wayback Machine (archive.org)**.
- Gets URLs that were **publicly accessible in the past**, even if deleted now.
- No live crawling â€” works purely from archived data.
- Cannot detect dynamic or JavaScript-generated URLs.
- Might give **dead or outdated URLs**.
- Useful for **OSINT**, bug bounty, and discovering forgotten endpoints.    
- Very fast and low-resource.
