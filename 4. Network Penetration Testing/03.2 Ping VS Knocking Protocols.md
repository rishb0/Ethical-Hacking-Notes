## Ping VS Knocking Protocols

**Ping protocols (ICMP ping, TCP ping, UDP ping, rping, ARP ping)** are not knocking protocols. They are **reachability testing mechanisms**, not authentication or firewall-opening methods.

Knocking protocols (like **port knocking** or **SPA**) are designed to **hide ports** until a valid sequence or encrypted packet is received.  

Ping protocols are used for **network diagnostics and host discovery**. They do not modify firewall rules or authenticate access.

## 1. ICMP Ping

- **What:**  
    ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) Echo Request and Echo Reply messages are used to test if a host is reachable.

- **How it works:**  
    • The client sends an **ICMP Echo Request**.  
    • If the host is alive and ICMP is allowed, it replies with an **ICMP Echo Reply**.

- **Purpose:**  
    • Network reachability testing.  
    • Round-trip time measurement.

- **Example command:**

```bash
ping 192.168.1.1
```

- **Relation to knocking:**  
    • None. It does not open any ports or authenticate anything.

## 2. TCP Ping

- **What:**  
    A method of testing connectivity to a specific TCP port by initiating a TCP handshake (SYN packet).

- **How it works:**  
    • If the port is open, you get a **SYN/ACK** response.  
    • If the port is closed, you get a **RST**.  
    • If filtered by firewall, no response.

- **Purpose:**  
    • Checking if a service (like SSH on port 22) is accessible.

- **Example command:**

```bash
hping3 -S 192.168.1.10 -p 22
```

- **Relation to knocking:**  
    • None. It is just testing port availability.

## 3. UDP Ping

- **What:**  
    A method to test if a UDP port or host is reachable by sending UDP packets and waiting for a response (or ICMP unreachable).

- **How it works:**  
    • If the port is closed, you usually get **ICMP Port Unreachable**.  
    • If open, some services might reply (e.g., DNS on UDP 53).

- **Example command:**

```bash
hping3 --udp 192.168.1.10 -p 53
```

- **Relation to knocking:**  
    • None. It is a diagnostic tool.

## 4. rping (RDMA Ping)

- **What:**  
    A specialized "ping" for **RDMA (Remote Direct Memory Access)** networks.

- **Purpose:**  
    • To test connectivity over RDMA fabric (InfiniBand or RoCE).

- **Relation to knocking:**  
    • None. It is specific to RDMA testing, not firewall control.

---
## 5. ARP Ping

- **What:**  
    A way to check if a host is on the same local subnet by sending **ARP requests**.

- **How it works:**  
    • ARP is used to map IP addresses to MAC addresses in local networks.  
    • ARP ping sends a request like "Who has 192.168.1.10?"  
    • The host replies with its MAC address if it exists.

- **Purpose:**  
    • Host discovery in local LAN even if ICMP ping is blocked.

- **Example command:**

```bash
arping 192.168.1.10
```

- **Relation to knocking:**  
    • None. It does not hide or unlock any service.

## Key Difference: Ping vs Knocking

| Feature            | Ping Protocols                    | Knocking Protocols                 |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Purpose            | Test if host or port is reachable | Authenticate and open hidden ports |
| Protocols Used     | ICMP, TCP, UDP, ARP, RDMA         | Custom sequences or encrypted SPA  |
| Security Role      | None                              | Adds stealth layer to services     |
| Effect on Firewall | No changes                        | Temporarily modifies firewall      |

✅ Conclusion: **Ping is a diagnostic tool, knocking is a stealth access mechanism.** They serve completely different purposes.
