# fping

`fping` is a command-line network tool designed to send ICMP echo requests (pings) to multiple hosts simultaneously, making it faster and more efficient than the traditional ping command when checking many targets or scanning networks. It is commonly used by network administrators for quick live host discovery, subnet scans, and network availability monitoring.

## Key points about fping:

*   Sends ICMP echo requests in parallel to multiple hosts.
*   Supports IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.
*   Can read hostnames or IP addresses from a file for batch pinging.
*   Allows scanning entire IP ranges or subnets using CIDR notation.
*   Reports which hosts are alive, unreachable, or summarizes results.
*   Supports customization of timeout, retries, packet size, and intervals.
*   Provides easy-to-parse output useful in scripts and automation.
*   Requires appropriate privileges to send ICMP packets.

## Common fping Commands:

Display help or usage information:
```
fping --help
```
or
```
fping -h
```

Ping a single IP address:
```
fping 192.168.1.1
```

Ping a hostname:
```
fping dns.google
```

Force IPv4 ping:
```
fping -4 www.google.com
```

Force IPv6 ping:
```
fping -6 www.google.com
```

Ping multiple IP addresses in one command:
```
fping 192.168.1.1 192.168.1.31 192.168.1.61 192.168.1.200
```

Ping hosts listed in a file (example file `ip.txt`):
```
192.168.1.1
192.168.1.10
192.168.1.31
192.168.1.61
192.168.1.100
```

Command:
```
fping -f ip.txt
```

Ping all hosts in a subnet using CIDR notation:
```
fping -g 192.168.1.0/24
```

Ping subnet with summary statistics:
```
fping -g 192.168.1.0/24 -s
```

Show only alive hosts silently, suppress error messages:
```
fping -g 192.168.1.0/24 -a 2> /dev/null
```

Save only alive hosts from a subnet scan to a file:
```
fping -g 192.168.1.0/24 -a 2> /dev/null > live-ip.txt
```

Show targets by name (reverse-DNS lookup for target IPs) :
```
fping -n 8.8.8.8
```

Ping hosts with retry for unreachable hosts and set ping interval (milliseconds):
```
fping -g 122.168.84.1/24 -a -R -i 10000
```
