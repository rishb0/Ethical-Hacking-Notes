	# Ping Commands :

## **Windows:**

To check communication or connectivity with a specific computer or device:
```
ping 192.168.1.1
```

To send ping requests continuously until you stop them manually (Ctrl+C):
```
ping 192.168.1.1 -t
```

To specify the exact number of echo requests to send (e.g., 50 times):
```
ping 192.168.1.1 -n 50
```

To set the size of each ping packet (e.g., 5,000 bytes):
```
ping 192.168.1.1 -l 5000
```

To adjust how long (in milliseconds) Windows waits for each reply before timing out (default is 1,000 ms):
```
ping 192.168.1.1 -w 2000
```

To continuously send large (5,000 byte) ping packets:
```
ping 192.168.1.1 -l 5000 -t
```

To continuously ping with the maximum allowed packet size (65,500 bytes):
```
ping 192.168.1.1 -l 65500 -t
```

**Note:**
- The `-n` option sets the number of echo requests.
- The `-l` option sets the size, in bytes, of each ping packet.
- The `-w` option controls the timeout in milliseconds.
- The `-t` option makes the ping continue indefinitely until interrupted.

Checks connectivity to one host.
```
ping 192.168.1.1
```

For batch sweeping in CMD:
```batch
for /L %i in (1,1,254) do @ping -n 1 -w 1000 192.168.1.%i | find "TTL="
```

## **Linux:**

To check network connectivity to a remote host (Google DNS):
```
ping 8.8.8.8
```

To send only 2 ICMP Echo Requests to a host:
```
ping 8.8.8.8 -c 2
```

To send pings with a large packet size of 65,500 bytes:
```
ping 192.168.1.1 -s 65500
```

To send 4 large (65,500 bytes) pings using a specific network interface (eth0):
```
ping -I eth0 192.168.1.1 -s 65500 -c 4
```

To send 2 pings at 10-second intervals:
```
ping 192.168.1.1 -i 10 -c 2
```

To send 2 pings at 10-second intervals, filling each packet with the byte pattern 42 (hex):
```
ping 192.168.1.1 -i 10 -c 2 -p 42
```

To check connectivity to a domain name (DNS resolution):
```
ping armourinfosec.com
```

To ping an IPv6 hostname (Google):
```
ping -6 google.com
```

To ping a specific IPv6 IP address, sending 2 packets with 10-second intervals, using the byte pattern 42:
```
ping -6 2404:6800:4009:80e::200e -i 10 -c 2 -p 42
```

To send pings as fast as possible (flooding ping requires root/sudo rights):
```
ping 192.168.1.1 -f
```

To flood ping a host with maximum-size packets (requires root/sudo rights):
```
ping 192.168.1.1 -f -s 65500
```

**Note:**
*   `-c` specifies the count (number of packets).
*   `-s` specifies packet size.
*   `-I` specifies network interface.
*   `-i` specifies the interval between pings (in seconds).
*   `-p` specifies the pattern to fill packet payload.
*   `-6` uses IPv6.
*   `-f` enables flood mode (very fast, potentially disruptive - use with caution).

Use these commands for network troubleshooting, performance testing, and checking connectivity on Linux:
```bash
for i in {1..254}; do ping -c 1 -W 1 192.168.1.$i | grep "bytes from"; done
```

## Practical Uses:

*   Quickly discover all active devices on a network segment.
*   Inventory devices for management or security monitoring.
*   Diagnose connectivity issues by identifying non-responding devices.

**Alternatives:** If ICMP is blocked, other discovery options include ARP scanning, port scanning, or SNMP queries, each with their own strengths and detection risks.

The ping sweep is a fundamental tool, but network defenders and attackers are both aware of its patterns, so prudent use and awareness of security controls are important.
