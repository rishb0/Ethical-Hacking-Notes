# Ping sweep (also known as an ICMP sweep)

A ping sweep (also known as an ICMP sweep) is a basic network scanning technique used to determine which IP addresses within a specified range are mapped to live (active) hosts. Unlike a single ping command that checks just one address, a ping sweep sends ICMP Echo Request packets to multiple addresses—typically all possible hosts in a subnet or network segment—and listens for ICMP Echo Replies. Each positive reply indicates that the device at that IP address is up and reachable.

## Typical Steps in a Ping Sweep:

1.  Define the IP range to be scanned (e.g., `192.168.1.1-192.168.1.254`).
2.  Send ICMP Echo Requests sequentially or in parallel to each address in the range.
3.  Wait for ICMP Echo Replies from the hosts.
4.  Record responding addresses—these correspond to live systems.

## Key Points & Considerations:

*   **ICMP Blocking:** Many firewalls or routers block ICMP traffic to defend against reconnaissance or denial-of-service attacks, potentially making ping sweeps ineffective on protected networks.
*   **Detection:** Excessive or repeated ICMP requests can trigger intrusion detection systems (IDS) or firewall rules6.
*   **Ethical/Legal Use:** Only use ping sweeps on networks where you have permission; unauthorized scanning is often considered intrusive or illegal6.
*   **Tools:** Common tools for ping sweeps include `fping`, `nmap -sn`, SolarWinds Ping Sweep, and scripts utilizing ping in shell or batch loops.

## Command Examples:

### **Windows:**

Checks connectivity to one host.
```
ping 192.168.1.1
```

For batch sweeping in CMD:
```batch
for /L %i in (1,1,254) do @ping -n 1 -w 1000 192.168.1.%i | find "TTL="
```

### **Linux:**

For shell sweeping:
```bash
for i in {1..254}; do ping -c 1 -W 1 192.168.1.$i | grep "bytes from"; done
```

Using nmap:
```bash
nmap -sn 192.168.1.0/24
```

## Practical Uses:

*   Quickly discover all active devices on a network segment.
*   Inventory devices for management or security monitoring.
*   Diagnose connectivity issues by identifying non-responding devices.

**Alternatives:** If ICMP is blocked, other discovery options include ARP scanning, port scanning, or SNMP queries, each with their own strengths and detection risks.

The ping sweep is a fundamental tool, but network defenders and attackers are both aware of its patterns, so prudent use and awareness of security controls are important.
