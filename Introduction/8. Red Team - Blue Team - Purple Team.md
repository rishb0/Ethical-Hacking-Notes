# Red Team / Blue Team / Purple Team

---
## Red Team (Offensive)

ðŸ”´ **Role**: The Red Team simulates real-world cyberattacks to identify vulnerabilities and test the effectiveness of an organization's defenses.

* **Objective**: Mimic adversaries to uncover weaknesses in systems, networks, and processes.
* **Techniques Used**:
  * Penetration testing
  * Social engineering (e.g., phishing campaigns)
  * Exploitation of vulnerabilities
  * Lateral movement within networks
* **Outcome**: Detailed report of vulnerabilities and exploited weaknesses.
* **Example**: Conducting a simulated ransomware attack to test the organization's ability to detect and respond.

---
## Blue Team (Defensive)

ðŸ”µ **Role**: The Blue Team is responsible for detecting, preventing, and responding to security incidents.

* **Objective**: Protect the organization's assets by monitoring, identifying, and mitigating threats.
* **Tasks Include**:
  * Log analysis and monitoring
  * Incident response
  * Security awareness training
  * Implementing security tools (e.g., firewalls, SIEM systems)
* **Outcome**: Strengthened defenses and improved incident-handling procedures.
* **Example**: Investigating and containing a simulated breach launched by the Red Team.

## Purple Team (Collaborative)

ðŸŸ£ **Role**: The Purple Team bridges the gap between Red and Blue Teams to optimize security efforts.

* **Objective**: Facilitate knowledge sharing and enhance organizational security by integrating offensive and defensive strategies.
* **Key Roles**:
  * Analyze Red Team findings with the Blue Team to enhance defenses
  * Conduct continuous testing and improvement cycles
  * Promote cross-training between teams
* **Outcome**: Enhanced security posture through collaboration and reduced knowledge silos.
* **Example**: Coordinating exercises where the Red Team shares attack techniques, and the Blue Team develops real-time defenses.
