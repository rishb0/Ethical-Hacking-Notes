# Penetration-Testing-Methodologies

## üõ†Ô∏è Penetration Testing Methodologies

Penetration testing can be conducted using various approaches depending on the depth of access and visibility granted to the tester. Each methodology serves a specific purpose in evaluating different threat perspectives.

### Black Box Testing

- **Description:** The tester has no prior knowledge of the internal systems, architecture, or credentials.
- **Use Case:** Simulates an external attacker trying to breach the system from the outside.
- **Focus Areas:** Perimeter defenses, firewall configurations, public-facing applications.

### üü® Gray Box Testing

- **Description:** The tester has limited internal knowledge, such as user-level credentials or partial architecture diagrams.
- **Use Case:** Mimics an insider threat or a malicious user with some access (e.g., compromised user account).
- **Focus Areas:** Session handling, privilege escalation, business logic flaws.

### White Box Testing

- **Description:** The tester has full access to system documentation, source code, configurations, and internal architecture.
- **Use Case:** Used for in-depth security reviews, such as secure code audits and configuration validation.
- **Focus Areas:** Code-level vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, logic flaws, secure development practices.

## ‚öîÔ∏è Black Box vs Gray Box vs White Box Testing

| Aspect               | Black Box Testing                | Gray Box Testing                  | White Box Testing                   |
|----------------------|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Knowledge of System  | No internal knowledge            | Partial internal knowledge        | Full internal knowledge             |
| Access Level         | External attacker perspective    | Limited access (e.g., credentials, docs) | Full access (e.g., source code, admin rights) |
| Testing Focus        | Functionality and external behavior | External behavior + limited internal logic | Internal structure, logic, and implementation |
| Tester Role          | Unauthenticated user / outsider  | Authenticated user or insider     | Developer, security analyst, or internal tester|
| Use Case             | Real-world attack simulation     | Insider threat or semi-trusted users | Code audits, secure development lifecycle  |
| Advantages           | Closely mimics real-world attack scenario | Balanced tradeoff between realism and insight | Comprehensive and thorough               |
| Limitations          | May miss internal flaws or logic issues | May not have full system visibility | Less realistic from an attacker perspective|
| Example Tools        | Nmap, Burp Suite, Nikto          | OWASP ZAP, Metasploit (with creds) | Static code analyzers, debuggers, source review |

## ‚úÖ Summary

- **Black Box Testing:**  
  Simulates an external attack without internal knowledge. Great for identifying surface-level vulnerabilities and mimicking real-world threats.

- **Gray Box Testing:**  
  Tester has limited knowledge (e.g., user credentials, documentation). This hybrid approach allows for deeper analysis while retaining realism.

- **White Box Testing:**  
  Complete access to source code and system internals. Ideal for uncovering logic flaws, backdoors, insecure coding practices, and deeper vulnerabilities.
