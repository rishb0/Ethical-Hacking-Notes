# Security Threats

Security threats are potential actions, events, or vulnerabilities that can compromise the confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA) of systems, data, or networks. Below is an overview of common threats categorized for clarity.

---
## 1. Malware

**Definition**: Malicious software designed to harm or exploit a system.

**Examples**:
* **Viruses**: Infect files and spread between systems.
* **Worms**: Self-replicate and spread across networks.
* **Ransomware**: Encrypts data, demands payment for decryption.
* **Trojans**: Disguised as legitimate software but perform malicious actions.
* **Spyware/Adware**: Stealthily gather data or display intrusive ads.

---
## 2. Phishing & Social Engineering

**Definition**: Psychological manipulation to trick users into revealing sensitive information.

**Examples**:
* **Email Phishing**: Fraudulent emails mimicking legitimate sources.
* **Vishing**: Voice calls attempting to extract confidential data.
* **Pretexting**: Creating false scenarios to gain trust.
* **Baiting**: Enticing users with fake offers to initiate malware downloads.

---
## 3. Insider Threats

**Definition**: Threats from individuals within the organization, whether intentional or accidental.

**Types**:
* **Malicious Insiders**: Misuse of access for personal or financial gain.
* **Negligent Insiders**: Unintended harm through carelessness (e.g., using weak passwords).

---
## 4. Unauthorized Access

**Definition**: Gaining access to systems or data without proper authorization.

**Techniques**:
* **Brute Force Attacks**: Repeatedly guessing credentials.
* **Credential Stuffing**: Using stolen login data from other breaches.
* **Privilege Escalation**: Exploiting flaws to gain higher access levels.

## 5. Denial of Service (DoS) / Distributed DoS (DDoS)

**Definition**: Overloading systems or networks to render them unavailable.

**Examples**:
* **DoS**: Single source floods the target system.
* **DDoS**: Multiple sources (botnets) used to overwhelm targets.

---
## 6. Data Breaches

**Definition**: Unauthorized access or disclosure of sensitive data.

**Impact**:
* Loss of confidential information
* Legal and financial consequences
* Reputational damage

---
## 7. Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs)

**Definition**: Prolonged and targeted cyberattacks aimed at stealing sensitive information.

**Characteristics**:
* Skilled attackers
* Use of sophisticated tools
* Long-term undetected presence

---
## 8. Vulnerability Exploitation

**Definition**: Exploiting flaws in unpatched or misconfigured systems.

**Examples**:
* **Zero-Day Exploits**: Targeting unknown vulnerabilities.
* **Misconfigurations**: Default credentials, open ports, insecure services.

---
### 9. Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks
**Definition:** Intercepting and potentially altering communication between two parties.
**Examples:**
*   Eavesdropping on unencrypted data
*   HTTPS spoofing
*   Session hijacking

---
### 10. IoT (Internet of Things) Threats
**Definition:** Vulnerabilities in connected devices such as cameras, smart appliances, and medical equipment.
**Risks:**
*   Insecure default settings
*   Lack of regular updates
*   Exploitation for use in botnets

---
### 11. Supply Chain Attacks
**Definition:** Compromising third-party vendors (e.g., suppliers to gain access to an organization.
**Examples:**
*   Malware injected into software updates (e.g., SolarWinds)
*   Exploiting vendor systems to reach client networks

---
### 12. Cloud Security Threats
**Definition:** Risks associated with cloud-based infrastructure and services.
**Issues:**
*   Misconfigured cloud storage (e.g., public S3 buckets)
*   Insecure APIs
*   Insider threats within cloud providers

---
### 13. Emerging Threats
**Definition:** New and evolving threats driven by advancements in technology.
**Examples:**
*   **AI-Powered Attacks:** Intelligent, automated cyberattacks.
*   **Quantum Computing:** Future risk to encryption methods.
*   **Deepfakes:** AI-generated media used for impersonation and fraud.
