# Bug Bounty

A Bug Bounty is a program where companies reward individuals for finding and responsibly disclosing security vulnerabilities in their software or systems.

## üîß How It Works

1. A company defines the scope and rules of its bug bounty program.
2. Security researchers test the software or systems within scope.
3. Vulnerabilities are submitted through a platform or direct channel.
4. The company verifies the issue.
5. A reward (bounty) is paid based on the severity.

## üíº Why Companies Offer Bug Bounties

* Improve overall security
* Cost-effective vulnerability discovery
* Engage with the security community

## üë®‚Äçüíª Who Participates?

* Companies: Google, Facebook, Microsoft, etc.
* Platforms: HackerOne, Bugcrowd, Intigriti, etc.
* Researchers: Security professionals and ethical hackers

## ‚úÖ Benefits for Hackers

* Monetary rewards
* Career growth
* Learning experience
* Community recognition

# üêû Bug Bounty Severity Classification

In bug bounty programs, vulnerabilities are commonly categorized into five severity levels: P1 to P5. These help determine how urgent and impactful a reported vulnerability is.

## P1 ‚Äì Critical
* **Description**: Easily exploitable vulnerabilities with severe consequences.
* **Impact**: Complete system compromise, data loss, or critical business risk.
* **Response**: Requires immediate action.

## P2 ‚Äì High
* **Description**: Vulnerabilities that can cause major damage.
* **Impact**: Unauthorized access, service disruption, or major data exposure.
* **Response**: High priority fix.

## P3 ‚Äì Medium
* **Description**: Moderately impactful and exploitable vulnerabilities.
* **Impact**: Limited data disclosure or access control issues.
* **Response**: Fix in the regular patch cycle.

## P4 ‚Äì Low
* **Description**: Low-risk issues that require specific conditions.
* **Impact**: Minor leaks or usability concerns.
* **Response**: Fix when feasible.

## P5 ‚Äì Informational
* **Description**: No real security impact; may be non-exploitable or duplicates.
* **Impact**: None or purely theoretical.
* **Response**: Often no fix required.

üí° **Note**: Some organizations use CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System) instead of the P1‚ÄìP5 model.

## Key Differences between Bug Bounty and Penetration Testing:

| Feature         | Bug Bounty                                                   | Penetration Testing                                  |
| :-------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------- |
| **Definition**    | Crowd-sourced vulnerability discovery program with rewards     | Formal security assessment by hired professionals    |
| **Participants**  | Public or selected external researchers (ethical hackers)      | Internal teams or third-party security firms         |
| **Scope**         | Broad, defined by program rules, often includes production systems | Narrow, clearly defined in a contract or agreement   |
| **Duration**      | Ongoing or long-term                                         | Time-limited (e.g., 1‚Äì4 weeks)                       |
| **Payment Model** | Pay-per-vulnerability (bounties)                             | Fixed price or hourly rate                           |
| **Approach**      | Diverse methods, attacker-like, unstructured                 | Methodical, follows frameworks (e.g., OWASP, PTES)   |
| **Cost**          | Variable, can be cost-effective or unpredictable               | Predictable, often higher fixed cost                 |
| **Use Cases**     | Continuous security feedback, catching unknown/edge-case bugs | Compliance, internal validation, formal risk assessments |
| **Compliance Fit**| Not usually accepted for regulatory compliance                 | Commonly required for standards like PCI-DSS, ISO 27001 |
| **Advantages**    | Continuous testing, real-world insights, diverse attacker mindset | Structured, trusted reports, meets compliance requirements |
| **Disadvantages** | Potential for duplicate or low-quality reports, harder to control scope | Expensive, limited frequency, depends on tester expertise |
