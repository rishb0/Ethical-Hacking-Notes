# Jump-Box
## üíª Jump Box (Jump Server / Bastion Host)

A Jump Box is a secure, hardened system used to access devices in a **restricted or segmented network**. It serves as a **gateway** between a secure internal network and an external environment.
***
## üîê Purpose
* Centralized and **controlled access** to sensitive systems
* Reduces the **attack surface**
* Allows for **auditing and session logging**
* Ensures **segmentation boundaries** are maintained
***
## üìå Typical Use Case
A penetration tester or administrator connects to the **Jump Box**, and from there, accesses internal systems.
***
## üîß Best Practices
* Use **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**
* Restrict access via **VPN or IP whitelisting**
* Enable **logging and session monitoring**
* **Harden OS**: Disable unused services, enforce updates
* Isolate from internet access (if possible)
***
## üí† Types of Jump Boxes
### ‚úì 1. OS-Based
* **Linux Jump Box**
  * SSH access
  * Lightweight, scriptable
  * Common in DevOps/Cloud
* **Windows Jump Box**
  * RDP access
  * GUI tools (MMC, PowerShell ISE)
  * Useful in AD environments
***
### 2. Role-Based
* **Administrative Jump Box**
  * For system admins
  * Pre-installed tools (Ansible, SQL clients)
  * Strong auditing and access controls
* **Testing Jump Box**
  * Provided to auditors/pen testers
  * Minimal tools (Nmap, Burp, Metasploit)
  * Isolated and time-limited
***
### 3. Network Placement
* **Bastion Host**
  * Public-facing
  * Located in a **DMZ**
  * First entry point into a private network
* **Proxy-Based Jump Box**
  * Acts as a traffic router or relay
  * Often integrated with PAM
  * Full session recording
### 4. Cloud-Native Jump Boxes
* **AWS Bastion Host**
  * Hosted in Amazon VPC
  * Secured with security groups
  * Often uses AWS SSM for agent-based access
* **Azure Jump Box**
  * Accessible via Azure Bastion or RDP
  * Supports Azure AD and conditional access
* **GCP Jump Host**
  * Runs on Google Compute Engine
  * Supports IAP tunneling for secure access
***
## üîê Optional Enhancements
* Session recording & keystroke logging
* PAM & IAM integration
* Temporary access credentials
* Alerting on anomalous activity
