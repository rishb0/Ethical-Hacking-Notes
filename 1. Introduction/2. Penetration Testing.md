# Penetration-Testing

Penetration Testing (Pen Testing) is a simulated cyberattack against a system, application, or network to identify and exploit security vulnerabilities ‚Äî just like a real attacker would. The goal is to **find and fix weaknesses before malicious hackers can exploit them.**

---

## üîç What is Penetration Testing?

**Penetration Testing** is the practice of evaluating the security of an IT environment by simulating real-world attacks. It's an **authorized and controlled** process carried out by ethical hackers (penetration testers) to:

- Identify security flaws
- Validate the effectiveness of defenses
- Understand the potential impact of different types of attacks
- Provide recommendations to mitigate risks

---

## üß† Why is Penetration Testing Important?

- **Proactively finds vulnerabilities** before attackers do
- Helps meet **compliance requirements** (e.g., PCI DSS, HIPAA)
- Validates **security controls** and patch management
- Assesses **incident detection and response** capabilities
- Enhances **security awareness** and training

## üß∞ What Does Penetration Testing Involve?

A typical pen test includes:

1. **Planning & Scoping** ‚Äì Define objectives, rules of engagement, and the scope.
2. **Reconnaissance** ‚Äì Gather intelligence (passive and active).
3. **Scanning** ‚Äì Identify open ports, services, and vulnerabilities.
4. **Exploitation** ‚Äì Attempt to exploit vulnerabilities.
5. **Post-Exploitation** ‚Äì Determine the impact, escalate privileges, pivot.
6. **Reporting** ‚Äì Document findings, risks, and recommendations.

## 1. Network Penetration Testing
* **Internal Network Testing**
  Simulates insider threats or compromised internal devices. Helps assess risks originating within the organization's trusted zone.
* **External Network Testing**
  Evaluates the security of internet-facing resources (e.g., firewalls, routers, servers) against external threats.
* **Network + PCI Segmentation**
Ensures network segmentation complies with PCI DSS standards to secure cardholder data environments.
***
## 2. Web Application Penetration Testing
* Identifies vulnerabilities in web apps, often focusing on the **OWASP Top 10** SQL Injection, XSS, CSRF, Insecure Deserialization, etc.
	* May include **Web + API Testing**, assessing how web apps interact with backend APIs.
***
## 3. API Penetration Testing
* Evaluates APIs for vulnerabilities like improper **authorization**, **input validation**, **rate limiting**, and **data leakage**.
***
## 4. Mobile Application Penetration Testing
* Targets iOS and Android apps for flaws such as
  * Insecure data storage
  * Weak session handling
  * Inadequate encryption
* Often includes **Mobile + API testing**
***
## 5. Desktop Application Penetration Testing
* Targets applications installed on end-user devices, focusing on:
  * Buffer overflows
  * Privilege escalation
  * Insecure file storage or permissions
***
## 6. Wireless Network Penetration Testing
* Evaluates wireless infrastructure for:
  * Weak encryption (WEP/WPA vulnerabilities)
  * Rogue access points
  * Poor network segmentation
***
## 7. IoT Penetration Testing
* Assesses the security of **Internet of Things** devices, which often lack proper hardening and patching mechanisms.
***
## 8. Red Teaming
* A full-scope simulated attack mimicking **Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs)**.
Combines physical, social, and technical tactics to test detection and response capabilities.
***
## 9. Cloud Penetration Testing
* Assesses platforms like **AWS, Azure**, and **GCP** for:
  * Misconfigured services
  * IAM role mismanagement
  * Data exposure risks
* **Cloud Configuration Testing** focuses on provider-specific settings (e.g., S3 bucket permissions, firewall rules).
***
## 11. Threat Modeling & Security Hardening
* **Threat Modeling**: Identifies potential attack vectors early in the design process.
* **Security Hardening**: Configures systems to reduce attack surfaces and eliminate unnecessary services.
***
## 12. Physical Penetration Testing
* Tests physical security measures by attempting unauthorized facility access, badge cloning, or tailgating.

# Hacking Phases
## Phase 1 ‚Äì Reconnaissance (Footprinting)
* **Passive Recon**: No direct interaction (e.g., WHOIS, DNS info, social media).
* **Active Recon**: Direct interaction (e.g., ping sweeps, traceroute).

## Phase 2 ‚Äì Scanning
* Port Scanning
* Banner Grabbing
* Vulnerability Scanning

## Phase 3 ‚Äì Gaining Access
* Exploit vulnerabilities in:
  * Networks
  * Operating Systems
  * Applications
* Privilege Escalation

## Phase 4 ‚Äì Maintaining Access
* Deploy backdoors or Trojans
* Use system as a **pivot point**
* Monitor network traffic
* Exfiltrate data

## Phase 5 ‚Äì Covering Tracks
* Clear logs and audit trails
* Remove installed tools or scripts
* Obfuscate presence to avoid detection
