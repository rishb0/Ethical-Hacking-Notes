# Phases of Penetration Testing

Penetration testing follows a structured lifecycle to effectively identify, exploit, and report security vulnerabilities. Below are the standard phases:

## 1. Planning and Scoping (Pre-engagement)

- **🔍 Objective:** Define the goals, scope, and rules of engagement for the penetration test.

### Key Activities:
- Understand client objectives, security policies, and compliance requirements.
- Define the **scope**: systems, applications, networks, APIs, physical assets.
- Identify **testing boundaries** (e.g., IP ranges, domains, accounts).
- Establish **rules of engagement**: testing timeframe, tools, escalation protocols.
- Obtain **written authorization** to ensure legality and avoid legal issues.

## 2. Reconnaissance (Information Gathering)

- **🔍 Objective:** Collect intelligence about the target to identify potential attack vectors.

### Key Activities:
- **Passive Reconnaissance (No direct interaction)**
  - WHOIS lookups, DNS enumeration, social media analysis, public breach databases.
  - Scrape metadata from documents or websites (e.g., using FOCA).

- **Active Reconnaissance (Direct interaction)**
  - Port scanning (e.g., Nmap), service enumeration, and banner grabbing.
  - Network mapping, OS fingerprinting, or interrogating services via tools like Netcat, Shodan, etc.

## 3. Vulnerability Analysis

- **🔍 Objective:** Identify and assess weaknesses that could be exploited.

### Key Activities:
- Perform vulnerability scans using tools like Nessus, OpenVAS, or Qualys.
- Identify:
  - Misconfigurations
  - Outdated software
  - Weak credentials
  - Exposed services or APIs
- Prioritize findings using CVE IDs and CVSS scores to assess impact and
## 4. Exploitation

🎯 *Objective:* _Exploit identified vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access or demonstrate potential impact._

### 🛠️ Key Activities:
- Execute known or custom exploits (e.g., SQL injection, XSS, buffer overflows).
- Leverage tools such as **Metasploit, Burp Suite, SQLMap**, or custom scripts.
- Attempt **privilege escalation** to gain higher-level access (e.g., root/admin).
- Bypass security controls (e.g., firewalls, authentication mechanisms).

---

## 5. Post-Exploitation

🎯 *Objective:* _Evaluate the extent of compromise and potential business impact._

### 🔐 Key Activities:
- Establish persistence mechanisms (e.g., backdoors, startup scripts, cron jobs).
- Perform **lateral movement** within the network (pivoting to other systems).
- Extract or harvest sensitive data (credentials, tokens, intellectual property).
- Assess impact on data confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

---

## 6. Reporting

🎯 *Objective:* _Document findings, exploitation methods, and remediation guidance._

### 🗒️ Key Activities:
- Create a comprehensive technical report with:
    - *Vulnerabilities discovered*
    - *Exploitation methods*
    - *Accessed systems or data*
- Include screenshots, logs, payloads, and other evidence.
- Offer **remediation guidance**: patches, configuration fixes, security best practices.
- Deliver both a **technical summary** and a **non-technical executive summary**.

## 🧠 Hacking Lifecycle

The hacker’s attack process often mirrors penetration testing but is unauthorized and illegal. Here’s how it aligns:

| Phase                | Hacking (Malicious)                       | Penetration Testing (Ethical)      |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Reconnaissance       | Info gathering via passive/active means   | Reconnaissance                     |
| Scanning             | Identify open ports/services              | Vulnerability Analysis             |
| Gaining Access       | Exploit weaknesses                        | Exploitation                       |
| Maintaining Access   | Install backdoors, pivot                  | Post-Exploitation                  |
| Covering Tracks      | Delete logs, hide presence                | N/A (not part of ethical testing)  |

## 7. Remediation Verification (Retesting)

🎯 *Objective:* _Confirm that vulnerabilities have been successfully remediated._

### 🔄 Key Activities:
- Re-test systems to ensure fixes are effective.
- Validate that configurations, patches, or permissions have been updated.
- Confirm no new vulnerabilities were introduced during remediation.
