# Vulnerability Management
---
Vulnerability Management is a continuous process aimed at identifying, evaluating, remediating, and reporting vulnerabilities in information systems, applications, and networks. Its primary goal is to proactively reduce the attack surface and protect organizational assets from potential threats.

----
## 1. Stages of Vulnerability Management
----
### 1.1 Identification

**Purpose:** Discover known and potential vulnerabilities in systems.

**Techniques:**
- Automated vulnerability scanners
- Manual penetration testing
- Code reviews and threat modeling

**Common Tools:**
- Nessus
- Qualys
- OpenVAS
- Burp Suite (web app testing)

**Data Sources:**
- CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) database
- NVD (National Vulnerability Database)
- Vendor security bulletins
- Threat intelligence platforms

---
### 1.2 Evaluation (Prioritization)

**Purpose:** Determine which vulnerabilities pose the greatest risk and should be addressed first.

**Assessment Metrics:**
- CVSS Score (Base, Temporal, Environmental)
- Exploitability and public exploit availability
- Business impact and asset sensitivity
- Exposure (external-facing vs. internal)

**Prioritization Techniques:**
- Risk matrix (likelihood Ã— impact)
- Threat intelligence context (e.g., active exploitation reports)

---

### 1.3 Remediation

**Purpose:** Eliminate or reduce the impact of discovered vulnerabilities.

**Remediation Methods:**
- Apply vendor patches or updates
- Change configurations to harden systems
- Introduce compensating controls (e.g., WAF, IDS/IPS)

**Remediation Challenges:**
- Operational downtime or compatibility issues
- Lack of automation and skilled resources
- Balancing remediation with business priorities

---
### 1.4 Reporting

**Purpose:** Document and communicate findings and actions taken to key stakeholders.

**Report Contents:**
- Vulnerability trends and metrics
- Current risk posture
- Completed and pending remediation activities
- Recommendations and next steps

**Audience:** IT operations, security leadership, compliance teams, auditors

---
### 1.5 Verification

**Purpose:** Confirm that vulnerabilities were effectively remediated.

**Verification Actions:**
- Re-run vulnerability scans
- Reassess configurations or controls
- Conduct regression testing to ensure no new issues were introduced

---
## 2. Key Components of Vulnerability Management
----
### 2.1 Vulnerability Scanning
- Conduct scans on a regular cadence (e.g., weekly, monthly)
- Include both internal and external assets
- Use authenticated (logged-in) scans where possible for better accuracy
### 2.2 Patch Management
- Maintain patch calendars based on system criticality
- Automate patch deployment for common platforms
- Include rollback plans for failed updates
### 2.3 Asset Management
- Keep a continuously updated inventory of hardware, software, and cloud resources
- Tag assets based on criticality and data sensitivity
- Use discovery tools to detect rogue or unmanaged systems
### 2.4 Risk Management
- Integrate with enterprise risk management frameworks
- Perform risk acceptance where remediation is not feasible
- Align remediation activities with the organization's risk appetite

---
## 3. Challenges in Vulnerability Management
---
- **Volume of Vulnerabilities:** Complex systems yield a high number of findings.
- **Zero-Day Exploits:** No patches available, requiring mitigations or workarounds.
- **False Positives:** Inefficiencies from unnecessary remediation efforts.
- **Prioritization Conflicts:** Teams may struggle to align security with business needs.
- **Resource Constraints:** Limited security staff, tools, and time.

---
## 4. Tools for Vulnerability Management
---
### Commercial Tools
- **Qualys VMDR:** Cloud-based, scalable scanning and remediation workflow
- **Tenable.io/Nessus:** Industry-standard vulnerability assessment
- **Rapid7 InsightVM:** Context-rich prioritization and live dashboards

### Open-Source Tools
- **OpenVAS:** Full-featured vulnerability scanner
- **Nikto:** Web server scanner for known issues
- **Wazuh:** SIEM-integrated with vulnerability detection capabilities

### Integrated Platforms
- **SIEMs (e.g., Splunk, IBM QRadar):** Centralized log and event correlation
- **EDR (e.g., CrowdStrike, SentinelOne):** Endpoint visibility and automated response

---
## 5. Best Practices
---
- Schedule regular scans and conduct ad-hoc scans for major changes
- Automate vulnerability triage and ticketing integration (e.g., with Jira or ServiceNow)
- Establish a formal Vulnerability Disclosure Policy (VDP)
- Incorporate secure coding practices into SDLC
- Monitor threat intelligence for emerging CVEs and zero-day risks
- Track and report KPIs such as MTTR (Mean Time to Remediate)

---
## Summary

Vulnerability management is a cornerstone of modern cybersecurity programs. It requires collaboration between security, IT, and business stakeholders to prioritize and remediate weaknesses before they can be exploited. When implemented effectively, it significantly reduces organizational risk and supports compliance efforts.
