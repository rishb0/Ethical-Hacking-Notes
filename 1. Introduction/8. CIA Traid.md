# CIA Triad

The **CIA Triad** is a fundamental security model that guides policies for information security within organizations. It focuses on three key objectives:

---

## 1. Confidentiality

**Goal:** Prevent unauthorized access to sensitive information.

**Key Strategies:**
- Data encryption (e.g., AES, TLS)
- Access controls and authentication (e.g., passwords, biometrics, RBAC)
- Network segmentation
- Information classification

**Examples:**
- Encrypting sensitive customer data stored in databases
- Requiring multi-factor authentication for system access

---

## 2. Integrity

**Goal:** Ensure the accuracy, consistency, and trustworthiness of data over its lifecycle.

**Key Strategies:**
- Hashing algorithms (e.g., SHA-256) to verify data integrity
- Digital signatures
- Version control and audit trails
- Secure data input validation
## Examples:

- Using checksums to detect file corruption
- Applying digital signatures to verify the authenticity of documents

---

## 3. Availability

**Goal:** Ensure that authorized users can reliably access data and systems when needed.

**Key Strategies:**

- Redundant systems and failover solutions
- Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) protection
- Regular data backups
- System and network monitoring

**Examples:**

- Hosting critical services on cloud infrastructure with auto-scaling
- Performing regular backups and disaster recovery testing

# The CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability)

**Definition:** The CIA Triad is a widely recognized security model that guides information security policies and practices. It represents the three core goals for protecting information assets.

## 1. Confidentiality

**Definition:** Ensuring that sensitive information is not disclosed to unauthorized individuals, entities, or processes. It's about protecting data from unauthorized viewing or access.

**Key Aspects & Examples:**
*   **Access Control:** Only authorized users can access specific data.
    *   *Example:* Usernames and passwords, multi-factor authentication (MFA).
*   **Encryption:** Converting data into a coded form (ciphertext) that can only be deciphered with a specific key.
    *   *Example:* Encrypting emails, databases, or files at rest and in transit (e.g., TLS/SSL).
*   **Data Classification:** Categorizing data based on its sensitivity level to determine appropriate protection measures.
    *   *Example:* Public, Internal, Confidential, Restricted.
*   **Need-to-Know Principle:** Limiting access to information only to those who require it to perform their job functions.

**Threats to Confidentiality:**
*   Eavesdropping (e.g., network sniffing).
*   Social engineering (e.g., phishing).
*   Data breaches (e.g., unauthorized database access).
*   Insider threats (e.g., malicious employees leaking data).
*   Weak or stolen credentials.
*   Unsecured storage of sensitive files.

**Measures to Ensure Confidentiality:**
*   Implement strong authentication and authorization mechanisms.
*   Use encryption for data at rest and in transit.
*   Enforce access controls and the principle of least privilege.
*   Provide security awareness training to employees.
*   Regularly audit access logs and permissions.

## 2. Integrity

**Definition:** Maintaining the accuracy, consistency, and trustworthiness of data over its entire lifecycle. It ensures that data has not been tampered with, modified, or corrupted in an unauthorized manner.

**Key Aspects & Examples:**
*   **Accuracy:** Data is correct and precise.
*   **Consistency:** Data is uniform and free from contradictions.
*   **Non-repudiation:** Ensuring that an action or communication cannot be denied by the originator.
    *   *Example:* Digital signatures.
*   **Change Control:** Formal processes for managing modifications to systems and data.

**Threats to Integrity:**
*   Malware (e.g., viruses corrupting files).
*   Unauthorized modification of data by insiders or external attackers.
*   Data entry errors (accidental).
*   System malfunctions or crashes leading to data corruption.
*   Man-in-the-middle attacks altering data in transit.

**Measures to Ensure Integrity:**
*   Use hashing algorithms (e.g., SHA-256, MD5) to verify data integrity.
*   Implement version control systems.
*   Employ digital signatures and certificates.
*   Enforce strict access controls and audit trails for data modifications.
*   Regularly back up data.
*   Use intrusion detection/prevention systems (IDS/IPS).

## 3. Availability

**Definition:** Ensuring that information and systems are accessible and usable upon demand by authorized users. It means preventing disruptions to service and ensuring timely access to resources.

**Key Aspects & Examples:**
*   **Uptime:** Systems are operational and accessible when needed.
*   **Reliability:** Systems perform their intended functions correctly and consistently.
*   **Resilience:** The ability of a system to withstand or recover quickly from disruptions.
*   **Disaster Recovery:** Plans and procedures to restore systems and data after a major outage.

**Threats to Availability:**
*   Denial of Service (DoS) / Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks.
*   Hardware failures (e.g., disk crashes, power outages).
*   Software bugs or glitches.
*   Natural disasters (e.g., floods, earthquakes, fires).
*   Ransomware attacks encrypting critical data and systems.
*   Human error (e.g., accidental deletion of critical files or configurations).

**Measures to Ensure Availability:**
*   Implement redundancy for critical systems (e.g., RAID for storage, failover clusters).
*   Regularly back up data and test restoration procedures.
*   Develop and maintain disaster recovery plans (DRPs) and business continuity plans (BCPs).
*   Use load balancing to distribute traffic across multiple servers.
*   Deploy DoS/DDoS mitigation solutions.
*   Ensure adequate power supplies (e.g., UPS, generators).
*   Perform regular system maintenance and patching.
